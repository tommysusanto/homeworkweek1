# This is Tommy's GA Week 1 project

This is a simple app demonstrating the use of Multipleboards and Segue.

The color of the navigation bars are edited programatically in the main ViewController class. This is done at runtime.
I also generated other classes for various view controllers on screen.

The command button's edges are rounded by adding key attributes layer.cornerRadius. This is also only visibile at runtime.

I added the instagram and soundcloud link on my info page, which opens up the safari browser and directs it to my page.

I added the Info button inside my goal's page that opens up the 2nd part of the page. Once you got to this page a congratulations alert box is displayed on screen.

I used custom fonts. All of them are stored in the "Resource" folder

All images are stored in Assets.xcassets
